# GUItest-3
This is the prototype GUI for the raspberry Pi. I will also be including all the other test python scripts that I was able to create with resources found online.

GUI test2 
The main concept of this code is that it has the bluetooth search inquiry already in the code. It is able to find devices that are advertising their bluetooth connection

bluetooth.py 
This file has the code that was used in GUI test 2 and another way that allows it to connect to a device by searching for its specific bluetooth address. In this code I was able to connect to the HoloLens (HIVE_HOLOLENS_2) that we had in the HIVE.
